                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Breakfast is still the most important meal of the day – especially when you’re trying to lose weight! A healthy, filling breakfast will give you energy for everything you need to get done between waking and sleeping. It’ll also keep you feeling satisfied and reduce those sugar cravings that can ruin your diet in the late morning and afternoon.
<div>
</div><div>There are loads of ways you can nourish your body – and satisfy your hunger – without overdoing the calories or spending half the morning in the kitchen.
</div><div>
</div><div>Here are the top 25 weight loss breakfast recipes for busy people!
</div><div>
</div><div>1. Bircher Muesli
</div><div>Homemade Bircher muesli is a powerful blend of oats, fruit, nuts and whatever else you fancy! You don’t even need to cook anything. Just put everything together in a glass container and stash it in the fridge.
</div><div>Bircher muesli is not only delicious but rich in healthy complex carbs, protein, and fiber. It contains everything you need to keep your blood sugar in balance and your tummy happy throughout the day.
</div><div>
</div><div>2. Chia Seed Breakfast Pudding
</div><div>Overnight Gluten Free, Paleo &amp; Keto Chia Pudding  ? The Ultimate Combination Guide! #chiapudding #keto #ketobreakfast #lowcarb #paleo #glutenfree #healthyrecipes
</div><div>Chia seeds are a fantastic source of plant-based omega-3s, which help to reduce inflammation and support cognitive function. Chia seeds are also packed with protein and fiber, which makes this delicious breakfast pudding a no-fail way to start the day.
</div><div>You can also add natural sweeteners such as stevia or Monk fruit to reduce the glycemic index without compromising on taste.
</div><div>
</div><div>3. Egg-in-a-Hole
</div><div>Who doesn’t love eggs for breakfast? Try a new twist on an old favourite by adding vegetables and cooking with coconut oil. Eggs are a rich source of protein and omega-3s, while whole grain bread provides a filling and nutritious base. The extra protein from the turkey will help keep your brain in order and your muscles in good shape!
</div><div><br></div><div>4. Avocado Pancakes
</div><div>The trendiest breakfast of the century! Avocado is not only an excellent source of healthy fats, but it contains a heap of fiber to knock back those hunger pangs. The lemon and parsley add flavour and alkalising health benefits. Whip these up and you’ve got a breakfast that’ll keep cravings at bay all day!
</div><div><br></div><div>5. Smoothie To-Go
</div><div>Fruit smoothie freezer packs lined up in a row on a counter, including kiwi and kale, pink power, caramel apple, blueberry muffin, spiced pear, and mango green fruit smoothie packs.
</div><div>Need a smoothie on the run? Simply make these delicious smoothies in bulk, pack them into bags, and freeze!
</div><div>You can make these smoothies as unique and nutritious as you wish: add protein powder, berries, leafy greens, chia seeds, and banana, and you’ve got a powerhouse of vitamins and minerals. Or mix it up with peanut butter, yogurt, and seasonal fruits. So easy!
</div><div><br></div><div>6. Two-Ingredient Pancakes
</div><div>That’s right: all you need for these super-easy pancakes are banana and egg! They’re not only gluten-free, wheat-free, dairy-free, and yeast-free, but they’re the perfect blend of protein and healthy energy. Bananas are a great source of both fiber and potassium, and they provide sweetness without unnecessary calories. And because you can make these pancakes in mere minutes, you’ve got no excuse for grabbing a takeaway!
</div><div><br></div><div>7. Keto Pancakes
</div><div>a stack of protein pancakes on a white plate</div><div>If you’re not into bananas, these protein-rich pancakes are your new best friend. Any fitness fanatic will love this powered-up breakfast that combines your favorite protein powder with delicious almond milk. You certainly won’t feel like they’re made from a weight-loss breakfast recipe! You can even mix these up each day by adding fruit, nuts or (healthy) chocolate chips.
</div><div><br></div><div>8. Cheesy Keto Omelet
</div><div>Is there anything you can’t do with eggs? This yummy, keto-friendly omelette packs a powerful punch of healthy fats and protein. The cheese makes it even more delicious while upping the protein and keto-friendly fat.
</div><div>This breakfast tastes indulgent, but it’s really not! You can also add herbs, onions, and salsa for extra flavor.
</div><div><br></div><div>9. Berry Smoothie
</div><div>Antioxidant-rich berries make this breakfast sweet without the need for any sugar. They also help to ward off those harmful free radicals and protect your cells from damage. At the same time, the fiber in the chia seeds helps to lower your glucose levels and keeps your metabolism ticking. Chia seeds also provide a healthy dose of omega-3 fats and healthy moisture to your entire digestive system.
</div><div>Want To Boost Your Brain Power And Energy?
</div><div>Omega 3 is critical to brain function as well as our overall well-being, but our body cannot produce it on it's own at significant levels. Consume this from a good Omega 3 Fish Oil Supplement!
</div><div>
</div><div>10. Turkey Sage Breakfast Patties
</div><div>If you love a cooked breakfast, you can’t ignore these turkey patties. The turkey is a perfect lean protein, and the fresh herbs and spices will boost the flavour tenfold. The onions and olive oil are powerful antifungal foods that can help to balance your gut flora and restore a healthy balance to your microbiome. It’s great for lunches, too!
</div><div><br></div><div>11. Protein Jello
</div><div>You read that right! Jello can be a healthy breakfast – if you make it right. Gelatin is actually a fantastic nutrient and a good source of protein. It helps with the repair of tissues, especially in the gut. Greek yogurt is an excellent source of calcium and extra protein.
</div><div><br></div><div>12. Egg Muffin Cups
</div><div>Packed with eggs and veggies, these muffin cups are great on the run and full of everything your body needs.

</div><div><br></div><div>13. Quiche in a Mug
</div><div>Got five minutes? Then you’ve got time for a delicious, low-carb quiche! Leafy greens, egg protein, calcium-rich cheese… all you need to get your metabolism in gear and your body firing on all cylinders.
</div><div><br></div><div>14. Baked Eggs Skillet
</div><div>Rise and shine – this breakfast will keep you going right through til dinner! It’s quick and easy to make and so good you’ll never want it to end. But it’s also high in healthy fats and nutrients, including magnesium, potassium, and calcium.
</div><div><br></div><div>15. Coconut Almond Paleo Breakfast Muffins
</div><div>Coconut Almond Paleo Breakfast Muffins are grain-free, gluten-free, sugar-free, dairy-free and 100% delicious. You don't have to be paleo to fall in love with these banana muffins. They are amazing! | theendlessmeal.com
</div><div>Muffins again? Yes! These are incredibly healthy but also grain-free, sugar-free and dairy-free. The bananas provide both sweetness and healthy energy, while the almond flour and coconut deliver extra fiber. And again, the eggs top it all off with protein!
</div><div>
</div><div>16. Spinach Donuts
</div><div>Just when you thought life couldn’t get any better, we tell you to have donuts for breakfast! These are donuts with a difference: they’re bursting with spinach. Even better, the matcha powder adds an incredible dose of antioxidants and flavor. They’re also totally gluten-free and dairy-free.
</div><div>
</div><div>17. Salmon Bagel
</div><div>The benefits of oily fish go on and on: anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats, delicious protein, B vitamins, selenium, and even the antioxidant astaxanthin. Throw that together with tomatoes, spinach, and egg and you’ll be brimming with healthy energy!
</div><div><br></div><div>18. The Healthy Latte
</div><div>Gut Healing Cinnamon Coconut Latte being poured into a mug
</div><div>You’ve probably heard about the benefits of coconut oil for healing a damaged gut. Well, this delicious morning beverage contains that and more: healthy fats for energy and cognition, cinnamon for blood sugar stability, plus conjugated linoleic acid, beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin K, vitamin D, vitamin E, and antioxidants!
</div><div><br></div><div>19. Spinach Scramble with Raspberries
<span style="font-size: 1.3rem;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div>Greens, protein, antioxidants AND color! What could be better? There’s plenty of fiber in the whole-grain toast, and the combination of spinach and raspberries will satisfy even the most adventurous tastes.
</div><div><br></div><div>20. Cardamom and Peach Quinoa Porridge
</div><div>It’s so good, it’s almost a dessert! Quinoa is a fantastic gluten-free source of protein and energy, while cardamom adds sweetness without calories. And who can resist a juicy peach? You’ll find plenty of fiber to keep your blood sugar levels in check and those sugar cravings at bay.
</div><div><br></div><div>21. Breakfast Tapas
</div><div>Need to feed a group? This is the ultimate recovery breakfast! Veggies, protein, healthy fats, a ton of flavor – and minimal preparation. Just throw it all together on a plate and you’ve got nearly every food group covered. Best of all, you can keep each portion in its own container and carry it over for lunch!
</div><div><br></div><div>22. Coconut Granola
</div><div>Nothing satisfies the taste buds quite like granola! This particular granola ticks all the boxes: sweetness, flavour, and satisfaction. Buckwheat adds a heap of fiber and a chewy texture without the calories, keeping your digestion in tip-top shape. The coconut is a fantastic source of good fats, antifungal benefits and sweet delight!
</div><div><br></div><div>23. Scrambled Tofu Breakfast Burrito
</div><div>
<span style="font-size: 1.3rem;">This breakfast has the power of protein with the Mexican flavors of cilantro, salsa, spices, beans, and lime. You’ve got fiber in the beans, protein in the tofu, and a fresh hit of salsa with every bite. And zero sugar!&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>24. Peanut Butter Energy Bites
</div><div>Need something quick and delicious? These moreish little bites are packed with protein, fiber, and good fats to keep you satisfied and full of energy. And they contain only five ingredients: peanut butter, steel-cut oats, flaxseed, honey, and chocolate chips. Just combine everything a bowl and freeze for a fast, nutritious breakfast on the run. No oven required!
</div><div>
</div><div>25. Rainbow Cottage Cheese Breakfast Bowl
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1.3rem;">The prettiest breakfast you’ll have all week – and made in minutes! The berries and pomegranate provide super doses of vitamins and antioxidants, while the cottage cheese is the perfect source of low-fat protein and calcium.</span><br></div></h4>
